This project is in partnership with Lockheed Martin in which a budget of $1,000 was supplied to develop addition and upgraded components to the vehicle. The car was built using the Jetson Orin processor on the Latrax rally RC car. Some of the projects requirements include:

1. The AI/ML platform shall be based on an open source hardware and software with a supported
AI/ML tools ecosystem
2. The project shall be a continuation of the previous year teams
3. The project shall integrate the capabilities implemented by two previous year teams into each car,
this includes simple track following, obstacle detection, variable speed based upon track
curvature recognition, and variable throttle
4. The project shall research and survey additional possible capabilities that the respective cars can
allow as extensions
5. The teams shall present the researched capabilities to the industry and faculty advisors, and
decide on at lease one additional capability to be added to their respective cars
6. The team shall successfully integrate and add the capability identified
7. The team shall derive detailed specifications on scope of the identified capability, once they are
identified
8. The team should implement one difficult scenario such as changing lanes, avoiding obstacles,
parking

The current status of the project includes the upgrade of the Jetson Nano processor to the Jetson Orin processor which provides over four times the computation power of the Nano. Much of the first half of the project included updating our team on the previous years project handoff and recreating the car's track.

Along with familiarizing ourselves with the previous years project. We also had to develop the knowledge and technical skills that come with the machine learning and artificial intelligence toolset. 

My main focus of the project is implementing the RPLiDAR A1M8 system with our RC car. This lidar will support our efforts with object detection in conjunction with the onboard CSI camera.
