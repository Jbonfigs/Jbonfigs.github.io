A collection of courses taken during my spring semester of senior year

CS 373: Automata Theory & Formal Language
======
Theory and application of automata and the languages they recognize. Regular languages, finite-state automata, regular expressions, context-free languages, normal forms, pushdown automata, context-sensitive languages, linear bounded automata, Turing machines, computability, transducers.

MATH 372: Dynamical Systems
======
Introduction to ordinary differential equations using linear algebra and geometry. The emphasis is on understanding long-term features of the solutions, rather than on solving the equations analytically. Topics include mathematical modeling; linear systems of differential equations; non-linear systems; stability of equilibria and periodic orbits; numeric methods; chaotic systems.

EECE 488: Senior Design II
======
Continuation of team development project using lightweight version of industrial approach. Covers hardware and software builds, integration and test, and project completion; scope, cost, and time. Individual assignments; team written and oral progress reports, periodic reviews, integration and test plans, system verification methods, project reports, and project presentations. Evaluation based primarily on team performance.

EECE 491: Teaching Practicum
======
Assist with undergraduate instruction of a formal course under the direct supervision of the course instructor.
