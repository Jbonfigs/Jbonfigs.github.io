A collection of courses taken during my fall semester of junior year


EECE 351: Digital System Design
======
Synchronous sequential circuit design. Algorithmic state machine method; state reduction; control-datapath circuit partitioning. Design of sequential arithmetic circuits. Memory interfacing; bus-based design. Specification and synthesis of digital systems using hardware description language and implementation using programmable logic devices. Simulation, analysis, testing and verification of digital systems.


EECE 315: Electronics I
======
Introduction to electronics, concentrating on the fundamental devices (diode, transistor, operational amplifier, logic gate) and their basic applications; modeling techniques; elementary circuit design based on devices.


MATH 304: Linear Algebra
======
Vector spaces, linear transformations, determinants, characteristic values, inner products.


CS 311: Operating System Concepts
======
Introduction to fundamental concepts for the design and implementation of operating systems: hardware/software interfaces; processes and threads; scheduling; synchronization techniques and primitives; memory management and virtual memory; file systems; input/output subsystems; resource and system virtualization; protection and security; introduction to distributed systems.


EECE 304: Signals and Systems
======
Provides an introduction to continuous-time and discrete-time signals and linear systems. Topics covered include time-domain descriptions (differential and difference equations, convolution) and frequency-domain descriptions (Fourier series and transforms, transfer function, frequency response, Z transforms and Laplace transforms).
