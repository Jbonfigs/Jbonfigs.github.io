A collection of courses taken during my junior year, *Fall 2022-Spring 2023*


EECE 351: Digital System Design
======
Synchronous sequential circuit design. Algorithmic state machine method; state reduction; control-datapath circuit partitioning. Design of sequential arithmetic circuits. Memory interfacing; bus-based design. Specification and synthesis of digital systems using hardware description language and implementation using programmable logic devices. Simulation, analysis, testing and verification of digital systems.


EECE 315: Electronics I
======
Introduction to electronics, concentrating on the fundamental devices (diode, transistor, operational amplifier, logic gate) and their basic applications; modeling techniques; elementary circuit design based on devices.


MATH 304: Linear Algebra
======
Vector spaces, linear transformations, determinants, characteristic values, inner products.


CS 311: Operating System Concepts
======
Introduction to fundamental concepts for the design and implementation of operating systems: hardware/software interfaces; processes and threads; scheduling; synchronization techniques and primitives; memory management and virtual memory; file systems; input/output subsystems; resource and system virtualization; protection and security; introduction to distributed systems.


EECE 304: Signals and Systems
======
Provides an introduction to continuous-time and discrete-time signals and linear systems. Topics covered include time-domain descriptions (differential and difference equations, convolution) and frequency-domain descriptions (Fourier series and transforms, transfer function, frequency response, Z transforms and Laplace transforms).


EECE 359: Computer Communications and Networking
======
Theoretical basis for and practical foundations of modern data communications within and between computing systems. Topics include: properties of signals and transmission media; data encoding and modulation, multiplexing, and multiple access; data integrity, error detection and error control, forward error correction; protocol concepts and design, flow control, sliding window protocols, data link control; local area networking, LAN standards, and interconnecting LANs; networking and inter-networking devices, bridges, repeaters, routers; inter-networking protocols.


EECE 387: Design Lab
======
This course provides experience with the engineering design process, which spans significant areas of electrical and computer engineering. Lecture will focus on various aspects of the design process as well as discussions of component characteristics.


MATH 381: Graph Theory
======
Directed and undirected graphs, trees, connectivity, Eulerian and Hamiltonian graphs, planar graphs, coloring of graphs, graph parameters, optimization and graph algorithms.


MATH 407: Introduction to Theory of Numbers
======
Classical number theory. Divisibility, prime numbers, quadratic reciprocity, Diophantine equations.
