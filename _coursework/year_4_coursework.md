A collection of courses taken during my senior year, *Fall 2023-Spring 2024*


MATH 463: Differential Geometry
======
Introduction to differential geometry via curves and surfaces in 3 dimensions. Topics covered include tangent spaces, fundamental forms, geodesics, exponential maps, parallel transport, vector fields, covariant derivatives, Gauss map, Gaussian curvature, Gauss-Bonnet theorem.


EECE 451: Digital System Design II
======
VLSI design, synthesis and test using hardware description language (HDL) at the register-transfer level (RTL). HDL programming and simulation basics, followed by advanced HDL programming for synthesis and test benching. Principles of RTL synthesis introduced. Design and synthesis of digital systems to meet constraints. Pre-synthesis and post-synthesis verification using simulation. Commercial synthesis tool discussed in detail.


EECE 487: Senior Project I
======
Design projects in cooperation with local industry, other external clients, and university sponsored projects - outlining specifications, proposals, time schedules, and paper designs. Periodic design reviews with client, written and oral progress reports, final presentation. Evaluation based on individual and team performance.


CS 373: Automata Theory & Formal Language
======
Theory and application of automata and the languages they recognize. Regular languages, finite-state automata, regular expressions, context-free languages, normal forms, pushdown automata, context-sensitive languages, linear bounded automata, Turing machines, computability, transducers.


MATH 372: Dynamical Systems
======
Introduction to ordinary differential equations using linear algebra and geometry. The emphasis is on understanding long-term features of the solutions, rather than on solving the equations analytically. Topics include mathematical modeling; linear systems of differential equations; non-linear systems; stability of equilibria and periodic orbits; numeric methods; chaotic systems.


EECE 488: Senior Design II
======
Continuation of team development project using lightweight version of industrial approach. Covers hardware and software builds, integration and test, and project completion; scope, cost, and time. Individual assignments; team written and oral progress reports, periodic reviews, integration and test plans, system verification methods, project reports, and project presentations. Evaluation based primarily on team performance.


EECE 491: Teaching Practicum
======
Assist with undergraduate instruction of a formal course under the direct supervision of the course instructor.
