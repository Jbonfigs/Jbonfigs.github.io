A collection of courses taken during my freshman year, *Fall 2020-Spring 2021*

CHEM 101: General Chemistry I
======
The fundamental laws and principles of chemistry of matter and energy, stoichiometry and chemical equations, thermochemistry, atomic structure, periodic relationships, and chemical bonding.

ENGS 115: Introduction to Engineering
======
This course is designed around a variety of engineering themes. Each theme is related to one (or more) of the engineering disciplines offered through the School of Engineering. Every theme involves project work emphasizing design, problem solving methodologies, critical thinking, and team participation.


MATH 285: Calculus III
======
Algebraic and geometric aspects of vectors, functions of several variables, partial derivatives, multiple integrals, vector calculus, line integrals, Greenâ€™s Theorem.


EECE 315: Probability & Statistics for Engineers
======
Basic concepts of probability theory, discrete and continuous random variables and their distributions, moments and characteristic functions. Empirical distribution functions. Parameter estimation and measures of their quality . Confidence limtis. Linear regression. Hypothesis testing and statistical approaches to engineering decisions.


ENGS 116: Introduction to Engineering Composition
======
An introductory course in computation for the practice of engineering. Focuses on Excel applications and structured programming techniques using the Visual Basic and MATLAB programming languages for the solution of engineering problems. Students are introduced to: use of the Internet as an information resource; software packages for engineering analysis and modeling; and computer applications for the preparation of documentation and graphics.


MATH 286: Differential Equations
======
This course focuses on techniques of solving first-order, second-order, and systems of first-order linear differential equations. Methods include separation of variables, variation of parameters, and the Laplace transform.
