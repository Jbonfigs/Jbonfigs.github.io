A collection of courses taken during my spring semester of sophomore year

EECE 260: Electric Circuits
======
Units and definitions. Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Laws. Analysis of resistive circuits. Circuit analysis using: Nodal and mesh methods, Norton and Thevenin theorems, and voltage divider. Transient and sinusoidal steady-state response of circuits containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors.

EECE 212: Linear Algebra & Engineering Programming 
======
An introduction to linear algebra for engineers with computer analysis, visualization, and mathematical programming. Linear algebra topics include matrix operations, systems of linear equations, determinants, solution to matrix equations, vector space, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Introduction to engineering programming includes variables and arrays, matrix operation, functions, data representation, user defined functions and a brief introduction on graphical programming. Engineering applications such as the matrix representation of graphs, matrices applied to electric circuits and linear systems will be introduced during the class.

MATH 330: Number Systems
======
Careful discussion of the real numbers, the rational numbers and the integers, including a thorough study of induction and recursion. Countable and uncountable sets. The methodology of mathematics: basic logic, the use of quantifiers, equivalence relations, sets and functions. Methods of proof in mathematics. Training in how to discover and write proofs.

CS 212: Programming II For Engineers
======
Development tools and methodologies for modular programming with an emphasis on engineering applications using the C language. Software design using functional and data abstraction. Specification, use and implementation of abstract data types including stacks, queues, lists, trees and graphs. Programming language features such as recursion, dynamically allocated data structures and separate compilation. Introduction to algorithm analysis, searching and sorting. Exposure to C++ classes for implementing abstract data types

EECE 287: Sophmore Design
======
Design-based introduction to embedded computer systems. Organization and composition of computer processors, memory, and peripherals. Introduction to assembly-language and embedded C programming. Design of hardware and software for embedded processor applications.
