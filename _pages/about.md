👨🏻‍💻 I'm a student at Binghamton University in my senior year of computer engineering and mathematics studies.

🔬 I'm currently apart of the Binghamton research experience for undergradutes (REU) program!

📚 I am actively pursuing my masters of computer engineering and plan to complete it in May 2025.

📽️ I also am a undergradute course assistant for a junior year embedded systems course!

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.
